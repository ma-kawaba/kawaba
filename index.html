            <h3>what is kawaba?</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Kawaba is a minimalist constructed language designed to reduce thoughts and communication
            to its most fundamental parts, emphasising simplicity, neutrality, and fundamentality. Kawaba
            focuses on expressing ideas clearly and intentionally using
            a minimal vocabulary of only 120 single-syllable root words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kawaba encourages speakers to see the world in a new way by breaking down complex concepts into
            their most essential pieces. Despite its small vocabulary, Kawaba is a flexible and creative language,
            relying on context and the combination of roots to convey a wide range of meanings.

            <h3>how kawaba works</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            The 120 root words of Kawaba can be divided into three catagories: 50 semantic primes,
            50 semantic molecules, and 20 grammatical roots.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Semantic primes are the foundation of meaning — universal concepts found in all human languages.
                    These are the most fundamental linguistic concepts, unable to be broken down futher.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Semantic molecules are more complex concepts that can be built by combining semantic primes.
                    These flexible building blocks allow for a wide range of expression.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Grammatical roots make up the language's simple, regular grammar that ties together the other roots.
                </p>

            The roots of Kawaba each have a broad and flexible range of meanings, encompassing a variety of related ideas.
            These can be combined to form compounds words that are as broad or specific as needed to fit the sentence.
            This modular approach lets you shape the language to fit your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Kawaba, roots aren't static — they grow and evolve as they're combined, shaped by their context and intent. 
            This dynamic interplay of parts invites speakers to think creatively and embrace the fluidity of meaning.
            By breaking complex ideas into their simplest components, Kawaba unlocks a whole world of expression with just a few roots.
